# BallandEnemy

This game is for player to control the playerball and not collide with the enemy ball. Once the ball is collided, you lost the game. 

I took this from a tutorial in YouTube to learn about game developmenet. The website is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrXkiM__AFw

Further improvments are done to the app by adding CoreMotion to control the ball movements. Next is to add more balls in a specific time and randomize the direction of movement of additional balls. 

Currently working on how to randomize the direction of movement of each ball, such that they move in a different speed.
